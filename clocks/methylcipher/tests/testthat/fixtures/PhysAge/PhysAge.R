# Create DNAm Physiological health Age (PhysAge) and DNAm surrogate scores
# Em Arpawong - 10/2/25

################################################
# Recommended steps:
# Step 0: Median impute CpGs that are missing for some samples
# Step 1: Impute CpGs missing entirely from your dataset using the "HRS_cpg_training_means.txt" provided
# Step 2: Calculate DNAm raw surrogate scores
# Step 3: Calculate continuous sum of z-scores for DNAmPhysAge score & convert to metric of years

### Output includes the following versions for the 8 surrogates and DNAmPhysAge:
# raw suffix indicates calculated scores of weighted CpGs
# _final suffix indicates the scores scaled in original values
# z prefix indicates standardized value (mean = 0, sd = 1)
# _years suffix indicates score is converted to age in years metric
